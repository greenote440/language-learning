# PWA Icons

This directory should contain PWA app icons in the following sizes:

- `icon-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixels (required)
- `icon-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixels (required)

## Icon Requirements

- Format: PNG with transparency
- Purpose: Should work as both "any" and "maskable" icons
- Design: Should represent the Italiano Audio brand/app
- Colors: Should align with theme color (#a84c2a) and background (#faf8f3)

## Creating Icons

Icons can be created from the app logo/design assets. For now, placeholder icons should be created to satisfy PWA requirements. In a production environment, professional icons should be designed and added here.

## Note

The manifest.json references these icons. If icons are not present, the PWA installation may not work correctly on all devices.
