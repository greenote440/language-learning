## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features

**Timeline:** Months 4-6 (Post-MVP, Core Product Development)

**Priority Features:**

- **Refined Model Implementation:** Enhanced operationalization of the foundation language acquisition model with finer granularity and more precise predictions. Model principles are refined based on MVP validation data, enabling more sophisticated content generation and adaptation. Rationale: MVP proves model works in basic form; Phase 2 increases model sophistication to improve outcomes.

- **Refined Passive Sensing:** Enhanced behavioral signal collection and analysis. System tracks more granular patterns (temporal alignment of drop-offs, replay patterns, skip sequences) to infer comprehension boundaries more accurately according to model predictions. Rationale: Improves adaptation accuracy without requiring explicit user input, building on MVP's basic tracking foundation. Model validation refines understanding of meaningful signals.

- **Coarse Learner Model:** Introduction of probabilistic learner model with confidence intervals, where model principles guide learner state representation. Model tracks comprehension across coarse linguistic layers (lexical vs. discourse-heavy) using trend detection rather than binary states, following model predictions about how competence evolves. System maintains multiple hypotheses about learner state and adapts content that works across them. Rationale: Stabilizes adaptation under noisy signals, prevents overreaction that could harm engagement, creates platform for future sophistication. Model provides theoretical grounding for probabilistic representation.

- **Session-Level Adaptation:** Content difficulty adjusts between sessions based on learner model updates driven by foundation model principles. System detects trends (improving vs. declining comprehension) and adjusts future content selection accordingly, following model predictions about optimal adaptation timing. Rationale: Enables meaningful personalization while maintaining engagement stability during individual sessions. Model guides when and how adaptation should occur.

- **Baseline Recalibration:** Periodic system that recalculates what counts as "easy" vs. "hard" as user improves, following model predictions about how baselines should evolve. Prevents content from becoming too easy as competence grows. Rationale: Maintains appropriate challenge level over time, addressing the plateau problem for long-term users. Model provides framework for baseline management.

- **Content Format Optimization:** System learns which content formats (stories, podcasts, educational) work best for each user and adjusts format mix accordingly, guided by model understanding of how different formats serve acquisition. Rationale: Personalizes experience beyond difficulty, optimizing for both engagement and acquisition. Model principles inform format selection.

- **Enhanced Content Generation:** More sophisticated content variation driven by refined model implementation—same semantic content expressed through multiple linguistic forms with controlled complexity differences. Enables hidden repetition and frequency effects according to model specifications. Rationale: Maximizes acquisition efficiency through optimized input exposure patterns. Model provides precise specifications for variation patterns.

**Success Criteria for Phase 2:**
- Model refinement improves adaptation accuracy (80%+ sessions show appropriate difficulty)
- User progression becomes measurable (users advance through comprehension levels)
- Retention improves to 40%+ 30-day rate
- Learner model stabilizes and provides reliable adaptation signals
- Model predictions align more closely with user outcomes (refined model is more accurate)

### Long-term Vision

**Timeline:** Months 6-12+ (Mature Product, Advanced Features)

**Advanced Capabilities:**

- **Fine-Grained Model Implementation:** Foundation language acquisition model fully operationalized at fine-grained linguistic levels. Model principles guide constructional and discourse-level competence tracking. System understands not just vocabulary difficulty, but syntactic complexity, discourse features (reference tracking, connectives, stance markers), and morphosyntactic patterns according to model specifications. Rationale: Enables precise i+1 targeting at linguistic feature level, maximizing acquisition efficiency. Model provides complete framework for fine-grained tracking.

- **Real-Time Adaptive Flow:** Mid-stream complexity adjustments during listening, driven by model predictions about real-time adaptation needs. System detects comprehension breakdowns in real-time and subtly adjusts speech rate, explicitness, or syntactic complexity without interrupting narrative flow, following model principles about optimal adaptation timing. Rationale: Represents ceiling of adaptivity, providing optimal challenge at every moment. Model guides real-time adaptation decisions.

- **Advanced Signal Fusion:** System combines multiple imperfect signals (behavioral, temporal, content interaction) to infer comprehension with higher confidence, using model framework to interpret signal meaning. Disentangles language competence from topic familiarity, preventing false adaptation signals, guided by model understanding of signal interpretation. Rationale: Enables accurate adaptation even with noisy passive signals, addressing measurement challenges. Model provides theoretical framework for signal fusion.

- **Video Integration (Phase 3+):** Optional video as semantic and cultural substrate, where model principles guide video selection and audio generation relationship. System fetches videos, extracts meaning/topics/cultural context, then generates adaptive Italian audio versions expressing the same meaning at controlled complexity according to model specifications. Video serves as engagement multiplier and cultural anchor; audio remains the adaptive surface. Rationale: Enriches meaning and engagement without contaminating measurement, as established in strategic analysis. Model ensures video integration doesn't compromise adaptation principles.

- **Temporal Dynamics Integration:** Learner model incorporates memory dynamics (spacing, forgetting curves) according to model predictions about temporal acquisition patterns. System knows when to reintroduce previously "known" content and when to push forward, following model understanding of forgetting and retention. Rationale: Optimizes long-term retention and prevents regression, addressing natural forgetting patterns. Model provides framework for temporal dynamics.

- **Model Validation and Refinement:** Continuous validation of model predictions against user outcomes, with model refinement based on empirical data. Model principles are tested, refined, and expanded based on long-term user behavior and acquisition outcomes. Rationale: Ensures model remains accurate and effective as more data becomes available. Model evolves based on validation.

- **Multi-Language Support:** Architecture expands to support additional languages using the same adaptive framework and model principles. Italian serves as proof-of-concept; system generalizes to Spanish, French, German, etc., demonstrating model's cross-language applicability. Rationale: Validates architectural approach and expands market opportunity. Model principles should generalize across languages.

- **Advanced Content Personalization:** Content adapts not just linguistically, but thematically and stylistically based on user interests, learning history, and engagement patterns, while maintaining model-driven acquisition optimization. Rationale: Maximizes engagement through content relevance while maintaining acquisition optimization. Model ensures personalization serves acquisition goals.

**Long-Term Success Indicators:**
- Users achieve conversational fluency faster than traditional methods (validated through external assessment or self-report)
- System demonstrates measurable acquisition acceleration (2x+ faster progression)
- Product becomes primary Italian learning method for engaged users
- Architecture proves extensible to additional languages
- Model predictions consistently align with user outcomes across proficiency levels and user segments
- Model principles are validated through long-term user data and acquisition outcomes
